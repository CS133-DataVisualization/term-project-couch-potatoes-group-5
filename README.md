# Work From Home productivity prediction

***
### Goal

In this repository we attempt to predict the effectiveness of remote workers based on several attributes.

***

### EDA
Various plots are visible in the file [plots](./plots.ipynb). We explore the various relationships between variables and their impact on WFH productivity. More EDA is visible in the P1 and P2 files, with interative plots. 

***

### Running / Training models
In the files [linear_regression.ipynb](./linear_regression.ipynb), [xgboost.ipynb](./xgboost.ipynb), and [RandomForestRegressor.ipynb](./RandomForestRegressor.ipynb) we create several models to predict productivity based on our EDA. To run the models, preprocess all the data by running the cells, and then fit/train the model by running the respective cell.
